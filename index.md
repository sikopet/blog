This is not a blog :-). At most it's a wiki/blog hybrid. Actually it is my
technical documentation, notes and diary. Some stuff from here is cross-posted
on [blogspot](http://jreisinger.blogspot.sk).

See all blog posts [here](https://github.com/jreisinger/blog/blob/master/README.md), some of the key ones are  (I think):

* [DevOps](posts/devops.md)
* [Linux - the Big Picture](posts/linux-big-picture.md)
* [Linux Performance Analysis](posts/linux-performance-analysis.md)
* [Networking Basics](posts/net-basics.md)
* [Testing a Perl Script](posts/testing-perl-script.md)
* [tcpdump](posts/tcpdump.md)
* [Big O Notation](posts/big-o-notation.md)
* [Git](posts/git.md)
* [Books](posts/books.md)
* [Splunk](posts/splunk.md)
