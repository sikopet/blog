But if Perl is everything it ought to be, it will naturally attract serious attention over the long term. If ecological niches are natural, and if nature abhors a vacuum, it follows that ecological niches abhor vacuums too. I expect to hear some great sucking sounds over the next ten or twenty years. -- Larry Wall in <a href="http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/02/09/06/1343222/larry-wall-on-perl-religion-and">2002</a>

It should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid. -- Albert Einstein

You learn a natural language once and use it many times. The lesson for a language designer is that a language should be optimized for expressive power [breadth of ideas that can be represented and communicated] rather than for ease of learning. .. It's okay if a language is difficult to learn, as long as you don't have to learn it all at once. -- Larry Wall: <a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/natural.html">Natural Language Principles in Perl</a>

It can do everything I want to do, and I already know it. If I wasn't a Perl programmer, I'd probably be happy in Ruby or Python. But so long as there's Perl, I see no reason to become as familiar with those languages as I am with Perl. -- Nathan Torkington (http://www.perl.com/pub/2001/07/03/nat.html)

Keď je nebezpečenstvo veľké, človek nesmie utekať. Odstúpiť sa dá v kľudnej chvíli, alebo keď už proste nemôžete ďalej. -- Joseph Ratzinger

Learning Perl is like learning a second or third spoken language. You’ll learn a few words, then string together some sentences, and eventually will be able to have small, simple conversations.

Ľudská bytosť je časťou celku, ktorý my nazývame Vesmír, časť ktorá je obmedzená v čase a priestore. Zažíva seba, jej myšlienky a pocity, ako niečo oddelené od zvyšku – akýsi druh optického klamu jej vedomia. Tento klam je pre nás akýmsi druhom väzenia, obmedzujúcim nás na naše osobné túžby a náklonnosť pre niekoľko osôb v našej blízkosti. Našou úlohou musí by vyslobodiť sa z tohto väzenia, rozšírením okruhu našeho súcitu pre všetky žijúce bytosti a celú prírodu v jej kráse. -- Albert Einstein
